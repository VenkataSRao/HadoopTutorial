Hive data types are categorized into two types. They are the 
primitive and complex data types. ^

Primitive Data Types:
====================


TINYINT     1 byte
SMALLINT    2 byte
INT         4 byte
BIGINT      8 byte
FLOAT       4 byte (single precision 

floating point numbers)
DOUBLE      8 byte (double precision 

floating point numbers)
BOOLEAN     TRUE/FALSE value
STRING      Max size is 2GB.


Complex Data Types:
===================

Arrays:
=======
Contain a list of elements of the same data type. These elements are accessed by using an index. For example 
an array, “fruits”, containing a list of elements [‘apple’, ’mango’, ‘orange’], the element “apple” in the array can be 
accessed by specifying fruits[1].

Maps:
=======
Contains key, value pairs. The elements are accessed by using the keys. For example a map, “pass_list” containing the 
“user name” as key and “password” as value, the password of the user can be accessed by specifying pass_list[‘username’]

Structs:
=========
Contains elements of different data types. The elements can be accessed by using the dot notation. For example 
in a struct, ”car”, the color of the car can be retrieved as specifying car.color


Below Create table statement with complex data types

CREATE TABLE complex_data_types
(
  Fruits     ARRAY<string>,
  Pass_list  MAP<string,string>,
  Car        STRUCT<color:string, wheel_size:float>
);
